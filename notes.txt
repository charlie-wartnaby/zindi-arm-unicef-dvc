Not well explained in competition but nature of required submission explained in discussion

imageid_categoryid   [count of that class in image]

e.g.
id_uawi0k5spci5_1	1  [count of 'other'=1 in image d_uawi0k5spci5.tif]
id_uawi0k5spci5_2	7  [count of 'tin'=2 ...]
id_uawi0k5spci5_3	2  [count of 'thatch'=3 ...]

So bounding boxes not required for submission, only to train something that can count.
