Not well explained in competition but nature of required submission explained in discussion

imageid_categoryid   [count of that class in image]

e.g.
id_uawi0k5spci5_1	1  [count of 'other'=1 in image d_uawi0k5spci5.tif]
id_uawi0k5spci5_2	7  [count of 'tin'=2 ...]
id_uawi0k5spci5_3	2  [count of 'thatch'=3 ...]

So bounding boxes not required for submission, only to train something that can count.

----
When conf threshold set lower, fewer false negatives, can I eliminate false positives?
o Sometimes got direct overlap of tin and thatch labels, so can eliminate weaker detection
o Sometimes get strongly overlapping tin labels, so can eliminate weaker again (but can
  get some overlap as bounding boxes not rotated about houses)
o Some matches probably too small to be a house in context of others in same photo
o Aspect ratio: very thin buildings more likely to be animal shelters? But to get aspect
  ratio correctly would have to rotate to get width/height dimensions, maybe using
  segmentation to get proper shape
